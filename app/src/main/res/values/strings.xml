    <string name="about_us_txt">Hello Polking\'s Member. We, the creators of Polking, welcome you to our Polking Family. We hope you are having a great day. And this application is helping you in your daily life. This is not a high end application with ML/AI integration. Just a normal application with normal usage. You ask normal question, People will give normal answer (Yes üëç/ No üëé). No other way. So no lectures. No knowledge. Just a Head and Tail situation. In between we also play a part of seeing the questions asked. So that it doesn\'t make a Chaos between the family ‚òπÔ∏è. So as a family member you also need to see this. Enjoy your life because it\'s short with this short application. ü•∞üòçüòò.  And yeah. One more thing. Please add your review on the Play Store, if you have time.  And one more üòÖ, please share this application to others also. And make our family big. Because more the better. ü•∫üòâ.
