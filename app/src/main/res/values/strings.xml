    <string name="about_us_txt">Hello Guys, Polking. An android application which will help you to deal with not all but
        some of the problems you face in your day to day life. Like should I buy this phone, should I rent a home at
        that place or thaaat place. You want to know what people think about your ideas before going all out. You want
        to know others thinking also. So that\'s why we build an application where you can have a vote not once in 5
        years but many in single day for not a government party but on your daily decisions. Use it to have fun but
        don\'t hurt others also. Last but not the least, Thank you for downloading our application Polking. Have Fun. If
        you want you can share this app using the below link to your family, friends and enemies. ;-)
